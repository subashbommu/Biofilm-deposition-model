# Biofilm-deposition-model
A continuum based diffusion convection model to study the deposition of bacterial cells using XDLVO theory.
Diff_convection --> Main Program to solve diffusion convection and calculate the mass deposition. Enter boundary and inital conditions here.
diff_fd --> Program to solve the diffusion convection using finite difference.
